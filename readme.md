## What this is

OpenRCT2 is the open-source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. This repository carries the
`amiga` branch: the same engine cross-compiled for m68k AmigaOS 3.x with bebbo's GCC 16, no SDL, no
threads, soft float, big-endian. It is a fork; upstream declined to merge it, so it lives here.

| RCT1 *Forest Frontiers* | RCT2 *Electric Fields* |

## Status

- **Plays.** RCT2 scenarios (`.sc6`, incl. Wacky Worlds / Time Twister) and RCT1 scenarios (`.sc4`,
  incl. Added Attractions / Loopy Landscapes) load natively and play; `.park` saves load.
- **Bit-exact.** The simulation produces the same entity checksums as the x86-64/arm64 build over
  5000 ticks, and scenario loads are identical at tick 0 — verified on a 68040 against a native build
  of the same tree.
- **Display and input** on an 8-bit RTG screen (640×480 recommended), mouse and keyboard through
  Intuition. About 25 fps at 640×480 on an emulated 68040; PiStorm and Vampire are faster.
- **Sound and music** through `ahi.device`: the RCT2 sound bank and `css*.dat` music. OpenRCT2's own
  Ogg music packs are not supported (no Vorbis decoder in this build).
- Not yet: networking, scripting. Mouse cursor shapes and the text clipboard arrived after test17 (untested on real hardware); a hardware-FPU build is being tried.

## Requirements

- AmigaOS 3.2 (tested on 3.2.3); an RTG card with a Picasso96 or CyberGraphX driver and an 8-bit
  640×480 mode (AGA/ECS-only machines are not supported).
- 68040/68060, PiStorm (Emu68) or Vampire/Apollo; about 300 MB of free Fast RAM.
- AHI for sound (optional; silent without it).
- The data files of the original RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 (GOG, Steam or CD). Not included.

See the [tester guide](distribution/amiga/TESTER-GUIDE.md) for installation.

## Building

Cross-compile on Linux or macOS: [distribution/amiga/BUILDING.md](distribution/amiga/BUILDING.md)
covers the compiler, the four cross-built dependencies (`build-deps.sh`), `configure.sh` and packaging.
